# Uber Trip Analysis

This project analyzes Uber trip data from April to September 2014 using Python, pandas, and visualization libraries. It combines, cleans, and explores the data to extract insights about ride patterns, peak times, and geographic trends. The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and descriptive statistics for a comprehensive view of Uber rides in New York City.
